//! # Item
//! The base element of this program, which all others work over.
//! Currently has no responsibilities, due to Bartend currently being structured in a data-oriented manner.
//! Instead, they are free floating structs to be operated on by free functions in the Presentation, Logic, and Persistance modules
//!
//! ## Potential Future Changes
//! Variants for mappings of IDs to quantities and names could be useful for Recipes, in a later version.
